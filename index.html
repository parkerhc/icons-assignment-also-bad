        <div class="column">
          <p>An estimated 1.4 million New York City residents rely on emergency food programs, including soup kitchens and food pantries, each year. In a city of 8.4 million people, that is a staggering sum, and often goes unnoticed by the rest of
            the populace. Food Bank NYC, a non-profit organization dedicated to serving underprivileged areas, estimates that millions of people suffer in a “meal gap”, where their dietary needs go unfilled. The meal gap for New York City is nearly
            208 million; that is, New York City residents who experience food insecurity fall short of an adequate diet by 208 million meals in a single year. New York City’s meal gap makes up over half (51.7 percent) of New York State’s meal gap.

        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <p>The coronavirus pandemic and the resulting economic downturn have led to a spike in demand for food assistance. One in Brooklyn alone reported in 14 weeks that had 800 phone calls asking for help. The staggering rise in demand is
            affecting wide sections of society.
